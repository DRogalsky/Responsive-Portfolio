            <p>I graduated from Whitworth University in 2015 with a B.S. in Health Science and shortly after started teaching myself to code. After a couple years of doing other work I decided that I wanted to make a career out of coding. After some research I ended up choosing the UW coding camp which is where I am now! My plan after the bootcamp is over is to find a job in web development.</p>

            <p>In my spare time I enjoy video games with a special interest in fighting games and strategy games. I also like to dance and used to TA for latin, swing, and ballroom classes. Sometimes I'll play my guitar or other instruments but I'm definately not in practice anymore. My favorite types of music are folk and metal but I'll basically listen to anything.</p>
