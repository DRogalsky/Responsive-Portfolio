# Basic-Portfolio

## Usage
Click the navbar to go between pages. The about page is just a small snippet about me. The contacts page is where you would send an email to me but currently the button does nothing. The portfolio page is just a place holder for now but the pictures will soon be links to my projects.

## Challenges
I'm a little less proud of this one but I learned a lot more. I used pixels to define a lot of sizes in this originally so for the resizing portion I had to basically rewrite a lot of the code. Also while my code looks good at those 3 specific levels all the random pixel definitons im usure about at this point make sizing in between weird.

If I were to do this and the first homework again I would start with reactivity in mind and not use pixels to define the size of things as much using more em and percentages along with vh and vw. This would mean the page itself would scale better overall and the changes I would have to make may be less sever.

one thing I am proud of is i got the form to scale at all sized below 680px since it let me concentrate on other parts
the nav bar doesn't really like being shrunk in my current styling so I want to figure out how to maybe write a mor reactive one
